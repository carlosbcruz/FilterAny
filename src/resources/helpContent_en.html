			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FilterAny was created to help on tedious tasks when working with text files. It is only necessary to execute a sequence of filters to generate the expected result. In some cases that is trivial, in other cases it can be compared to a simple puzzle.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some tasks examples that people probably had to do manually: 
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>
				When copying a content from one tool to another one and having that adjusting the position of the text manually.
			</li>
			 
			<li>
				When receiving one list with any information and having to verify one by one if there are repeated information or not. 
			</li>
			
			<li>
				When  copying something from Internet and the text came with strange text in many places and it is necessary to remove one by one. 
			</li>
			
			<li>
				When having to move a text to a spreadsheet and having to position each information in the correct cell one by one. 
			</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This list of tasks is a small example of where FilterAny can be used. It is possible to use some imagination and is clear to see many other situations where FilterAny can be used.
		</p>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of the tool is very simple. It is just necessary to copy and paste any text into the Input Area, then a filter can be applied generating a filtered text into the Output Area. If it is necessary to apply one another filter, then the content can be brought back to the Input Area with a simple click on a button. This process is repeated until the expected result is reached.  
		</p>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FilterAny interface is very simple.

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1 shows to the FilterAny main window with its 5 main areas. Areas 1 and 2 are the Input Areas, the area 1 is the Main Input and the area 2 is the Auxiliary Input. The area 3 allows the selection of the filter to be applied on the text that is on the Input Areas. Area 4 allows some configurations for the selected filter. Area 5 is the Output Area. After the selected filter is applied on the content of the Input Areas the result is generated on the Ouput Area.

		</center>
		
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence of use of the FilterAny follows the steps indicated in picture 2. First it is necessary to provide any content in the Input Areas. After that the desired filter is selected on Area 3. Configure the filter on area 4. Finally, execute the filter and the result is generated on the Output Area. If it is still necessary to apply the filter then it is possible to exchange the content between the Input and Output Area and the process is repeated until the desired result is reached.

		</center>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each filter can be configured independently. Once a filter is selected the filter configuration area is adapted automatically to the selected filter, as shown on picture 3. Amongst the configuration items there is a button with a magnifying glass icon to get an example of the filter functionality and another button with the label “Help” to get an explanation about the filter. If the “Help” button is disabled then the help is on automatic mode and each time a filter is selected it's instructions are presented automatically. Use the tool bar to enable or disable this behavior. 
		</p>

		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FilterAny also provide an execution through command line for advanced users. It is possible to execute three types of action: 
		</p>
			
		<ol>
		
			<li>
				Execute a filter.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Execute a sequence of filters specified on a script.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Open the console mode, where it is possible to interact with FilterAny. 
			</li>
			
		</ol>	
			
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these information it is possible to work with the FilterAny. The filters name are  well descriptive and the example button and local help are always available in the main window.
