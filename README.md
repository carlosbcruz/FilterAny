# FilterAny
Tool to apply many filters to texts and files.

The FilterAny was created to help on tedious tasks when working with text files. It is only necessary to execute a sequence of filters to generate the expected result. In some cases that is trivial, in other cases it can be compared to a simple puzzle.
Here are some tasks examples that some people probably had to do manually:
• When copying a content from one tool to another one and having that adjusting the position of the text manually.
• When receiving one list with any information and having to verify one by one if there are repeated information or not.
• When  copying something from Internet and that text came with strange text characters in many places and it is necessary to remove one by one.
• When having that move a text into a spreadsheet and having to position each information in correct cell one by one.
This list of tasks is a small example of where FilterAny can be used. It is possible to use some imagination and is clear to see many other situations where FilterAny can be used.
The concept of the tool is very simple. It is just necessary to copy and paste any text into the Input Area, then a filter can be applied generating a filtered text into the Output Area. If it is necessary to apply one another filter, then the content can be brought back to the Input Area with a simple click on a button. This process is repeated until the expected result is reached.
